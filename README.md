About
-----
This is a hobby project of me, on which I work in my free time.

Pull requests are more than welcome, but you should open an issue first, so we can talk about it.

I reverse-engineered the protocol implementation by looking at the (barely) obfuscated Javascript code on the agar.io website.
Although it would be much easier now to write a client, because [there is a wiki](http://agar.gcommer.com/) describing the whole protocol and most game mechanics.

If you have any game-related questions, feel free to ask in the [#agariomods IRC channel on the Rizon network](http://irc.lc/rizon/agariomods/CodeBlob@@@).
For questions about this client specifically, [open an issue](https://github.com/Gjum/agarnet/issues/new) or write me an email: [code.gjum@gmail.com](mailto:code.gjum@gmail.com)

Disclaimer
----------
This project isn't affiliated with [agar.io](http://agar.io/) in any way. When playing with this client, you do not get advertisements, which may be nice for you, but does not pay for the servers needed to run the game.
